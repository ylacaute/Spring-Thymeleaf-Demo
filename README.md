# SpringThymeleafDemo

For now, this project is personal. The main goal is to show how Thymeleaf can be powerful and easy to work with :)

## TODO
* Change input validation message on hover (currently, defined by the broswer)
* Put all text in i18n messages
* Add a service which define all available langages
* Add a combo in the top menu to choose the langage
* Add a generic system to load fragments in ajax and have a loader displayed during the load in place of the future fragment
* Add a generic system to let the user know that something is happening in ajax : must be displayed as a discreet spinner in the top menu for example
* Add Spring security : some pages will then need to be logged with a dummy login/pwd
